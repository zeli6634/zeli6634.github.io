    <p><h3>My Pet</h3></p>

      I have a cat in China. She is a lovely exotic shorthair cat. She has short but really soft hair with white and brown color, and a big face with big eyes. She is 11 years old. Although she is old as a cat, she still active. I can still play around with her.
    <br />
      My cat has a story with her. She was purchased by one of my father's friend in Europe. She had gone to a lot of cat beauty pageant and won a lot of prizes. Her children also won a lot of prizes in cat beauty pageant.
    <br />
      My father's friend gave her to me as a gift. I really enjoy spending time with her. When I was in high school, she woke me up every morning so I never late for class. She can understand what I said to her. If she wants to play with me, but I am doing my homework, I can just tell her I am working on my homework, and she will wait for me to finished my homework. I really love her!
